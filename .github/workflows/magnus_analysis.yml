              ## Details
              1. New feature implementation looks solid! Great job on modularizing the code. 👍
              2. Potential performance bottleneck detected in the data processing function. Consider using async operations.
              3. UI responsiveness improved by 15% in the main dashboard component.
              4. Suggested additional test for edge case in user authentication flow.
              5. Minor code style inconsistencies found. Recommend running our linter.

              ## Recommendations
              1. Optimize the data processing function to improve performance.
              2. Add error handling for the identified edge case in user authentication.
              3. Schedule a code review session to address minor style inconsistencies.
